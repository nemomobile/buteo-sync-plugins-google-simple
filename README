buteo-sync-plugins-google-simple
=================================

This is a simplified fork of the buteo-sync-plugins-google[1] repository.

This package provides a "client" synchronization plugin to the Buteo
sync framework.  It connects to Google using a valid account
(accounts&sso framework) and synchronizes contact data from the Google
Contacts service to the device.

Note: this plugin performs one-way sync only.
